/*
	Here we're going to overwrite the Maple Syrup item in-game.
	This is NOT A RECOMMENDED PROCESS as it is always better to tweak just portions
	of an item rather than overwrite it.  However, in this game ItemTweaker consistently
	fails to apply the FoodType value and it's just easier to overwrite it.  Eventually
	if the dev's change the pancakes it'll break this mod.

	There are two fundamental changes made to MapleSyrup here.
	1:	Spice = false
		By default "Spice = true" but this causes 2 issues for us.
		A:	The EvolvedRecipe for Pancakes and Waffles does not allow spice to be added until another item is added.
			We can get around this by setting "CanAddSpicesEmpty:true," in both the evolved recipes if we wish
		B:	Spice adds very little nutritional value AND it doesn't rename the item either.  By setting Spice = False
			we can reclassify Syrup as a condiment and make actual "Maple Syrup Pancakes" and "Maple Syrup Waffles"
	2:	FoodType = NoExplicit
		This setting allows the game to understand what type of food this item is when it is added to a recipe.
		By default this value does not exist because it is a spice. Once we remove the spice attribute we seem to
		have to tell the game what type of food it is.  I'm using NoExplicit so that it can still be added to pancakes
		and waffles while not showing up in the fruits menu, etc. It is now treated as a condiment

	With these 2 changes made, Syrup is now handled as a condiment and able to be added to Pancakes and Waffles any time 
	as well as rename them to "Maple Syrup (item)".  The only idiocy here is that pancakes without syrup give you -10 Unhappy.
	If you add syrup it drops to -5. This seems to be an issue with how evolved recipes are generated and out of my control.
	Even adding Strawberries or other fruits causes the unhappiness to go away. I haven't been able to figure out how to 
	override that without completely reworking the evolved recipe logic as a whole.  Which far exceeds the effort I'm
	willing to put into a simple little mod to make maple syrup pancakes
