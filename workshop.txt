title=Maple Syrup Fix
description=Overwrites Maple Syrup to be recognized as a condiment so that it can be added to Pancakes and Waffles to produce "Maple Syrup Pancakes" and "Maple Syrup Waffles".

description=In vanilla Maple Syrup is treated as a spice and pancakes/waffles are programmed to not accept spices without first having fruits added to them.  it's a strange decision on the developers behalf so I made this change.  Special shout out to "[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198388769267]BeatlJoe[/url]" for pointing out this inconsistency and inspiring this mod.

description=[h1]FYI[/h1]
description=When adding items to evolved recipes stats get mixed into each other.  Maple Syrup adds Happiness but for some reason if you add more than 1 instance of syrup happiness goes down to zero.  It's just something about how the engine handles these recipes and is out of my control.

description=For lore purposes we can just assume at this point you've drowned your pancakes/waffles and though they're edible, they're just not optimal anymore.
